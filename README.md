# paw-patrol
A Paw Patrol soundboard based off the 30 Day JavaScript Drum Kit project.
This is mostly just a passion project, as my daughter really loves Paw Patrol.

I will likely make the page include Ryder sometime in the future and correct a bug with mouse clicks not restarting the audio.
Right now, the web app "works" and I am working on a few other things.

## usage
Shell: `open index.html`
GUI: double click on `index.html` in Finder/Explorer.
